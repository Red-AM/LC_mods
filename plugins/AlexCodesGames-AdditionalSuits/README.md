# Additional Suits v1.1.1
## About
Adds 8 more standard suits to your initial closet at the start of the game! Great for organizing larger crews!

Please leave a thumbs up if you enjoyed the mod!

## Instructions - Installation
Automatic: Click 'Install with Mod Manager' button (ensure you have the Thunderstore mod manager installed).

Manual: Export the main folder into your BepInEx/plugins folder.

After installation you will see the new suits when you launch the game.

## Instructions - Adding Suits
All suite definitions are in the 'suit-defs.json', this includes details such as each suit's name & if it needs to be unlocked to be used. To add a new suite to your game just follow these steps:

    1 - Place your new texture file in the resource folder ('resAdditionalSuits')
    2 - Create a new JSON entry in the 'suit-defs.json' file to represent your suit

When you load your game your new suit should be added!
