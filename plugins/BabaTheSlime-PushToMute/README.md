# PushToMute
### A quick and simple mod that turns your in-game Push-to-Talk into a Push-to-Mute!

## Instructions
Drag and Drop the ```PushToMute.dll``` in your ```BepInEx/Plugins``` folder.

## Customize
You can change the keybinding in the settings menu - This mod uses the Push-to-Talk Keybind!
Note: The keybinding will still read as "Push to Talk" in-game. The mod works in the spectate screen, even though the visual indicator will still display as "Speaking"

## Changelog
	- v1.2.0 
		- Moved Push-to-Mute to Voice Activation, as it was strange to have essentially Voice Actication and Voice Activation+
	- v1.0.0
		- Release
