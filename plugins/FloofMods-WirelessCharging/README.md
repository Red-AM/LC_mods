# Feature(1)
When on the ship, items in inventory slots will slowly recharge over time. Does **not** affect dropped items.

Tested on multiplayer with FlipMods' [ReservedItemSlot](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/FlipMods/ReservedItemSlotCore/) mods. Should work fine with other mods that add more slots.
